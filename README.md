# RentOutdoors
A web app where you can rent the equipment you need when you are going outdoor, or if you have some extra equipment you're not using you can rent it and get some extra money.
## What I learned
- Create a new web app from scratch using ruby on rails.
- Work as a team: communication, resolution of conflicts in the code.
